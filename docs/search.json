    "text": "This page seeks to see if there are underlying trends based one what placing a competitor took in both the Absolute class and their own weight class.\n\n\nWhen we look at each individual placing, 1 through 3, in the absolute and compare it to the weight weight class of the competitor a few insights appear.\n\nWe see the general trend of Medium Heavy to Super Heavy being the weight classes that perform the best that we saw in our overview still holds even at the individual placing level.\nMore intrestingly we see taking 2nd and 3rd in the absolute have very similair breakdowns of weight classes, but for taking 1st we see a much higher proportion of competitors fall in the Heavy and particularly the Super Heavy classes, with the Medium Heavy weight class having a significant drop off. The Super Heavy and Heavy weight classes by themselves make up 50% of the 1st place winners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at the relationship between how well a competitor placed in their weight class in comparison to the Absolute class, unsurprisingly we see that the better a competitor does in their weight class the more likely they are to do well in the absolute class. Although it is still striking to see that nearly %80 of 1st place winners of the absolute took 1st int their weight class. In short taking 1st in your weight class is a very strong signal you will perform well in the absolute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we look at the overall distribution of Competitors that made the podium in the absolute class, we see the trend of 1st place winners from the weight class performing well in the absolute holds. Out of all competitors who placed in the absolute at all the vast majority were those who had placed 1st in their weight class division."

    "text": "This project aims to determine using data what weight a competitor needs to be to have realistic chance of winning the Absolute class at the highest levels.\nThe project looks at Tournament data from the entire history of the IBJJF. Only considering the Black Belt level for both GI and No-GI at the following major tournaments.\nIBJJF Worlds\nIBJJF Pans\nIBJJF Europeans\nBrazilian Nationals\n\nFirst Look\nOn our first look of the data a few insights stand out.\n\nThere is clear up tick in placings starting at Medium Heavy and a consistent drop off at Ultra Heavy. This leads me to believe that you need to be big enough to place in the absolute, but weight has diminishing returns. We likely see the drop off at Ultra Heavy due to many of these athletes being Ultra Heady due to excess body weight and not necessarily pure size and stature. Perhaps causing them to be not as athletic in comparison to the slightly smaller competitors in the Super Heavy etc… weight classes, that contain a weight class.\n\nreadRDS(file.path(Path_Data,“Overview.rds”))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere seems to be no meaningful difference between the GI and NO-GI categories and our overall trend holds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly we do see a difference between Male and Female categories. With the Female category having a noticeably flatter distribution. This could imply that weight is less important to placing in the absolute for women. However our dataset is small enough that this may be caused by a small sample size. If we took data across all belt levels, or a larger set of tournaments we could be more confident in this trend."
