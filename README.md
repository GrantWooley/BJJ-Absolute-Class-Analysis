# BJJ Absolute Class Analysis
In this project I will be doing an analysis on BJJ tournament results to determine what is the minimum
weight a competitor needs to be to have a realistic chance at winning the absolute class at a major tournament.
The primary purpose of this project is to combine my passion for BJJ with my desire to build skills
that I will need to eventually become a data engineer.

#Overview
The project will ultimately contain the following:
1.Python data pipeline pulling web data and storing in Postgres DB.
2.Postgres DB set up for raw data.
3.Python data pipeline pulling raw data from postgres DB, cleaning, and then storing in it a MSSQL DB. 
4.Setting up of Microsoft SQL DB
5.Power BI or Possibly Python Dashboard where I take data from MSSQL DB and visualize and do analysis to answer
the question "How much do you need to weigh to win a the absolute class at a major BJJ tournament."

#Updates
8.5.24 Completed development of all webscraping .py files and successfully scraped all IBJJF major tournament web pages.
